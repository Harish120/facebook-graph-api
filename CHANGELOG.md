## Migration Guide

### From Facebook PHP SDK

If you're migrating from the archived Facebook PHP SDK:

#### Old Way
```php
$fb = new Facebook\Facebook([
    'app_id' => 'app_id',
    'app_secret' => 'app_secret',
    'default_graph_version' => 'v2.10',
]);

$response = $fb->get('/me', 'access_token');
$user = $response->getGraphUser();
```

#### New Way
```php
// Using Facade
$response = FacebookGraph::getUserProfile($accessToken);
$user = $response->getData();

// Or using service
$response = app(FacebookGraphApiInterface::class)->getUserProfile($accessToken);
$user = $response->getData();
```
